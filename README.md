# Wikipedia Search Application

A simple Wikipedia search application allowing users to search for articles and view their content. The application is built using Python, utilizing Tkinter for the graphical interface and the Wikipedia library to fetch article content.

Users can input search queries and retrieve corresponding Wikipedia articles. The application gracefully handles ambiguous search results by presenting options to choose from and manages cases where no matches are found.

To use the application, users clone the repository, install dependencies listed in `requirement.txt`, and execute the Python script. Contributions are welcome; contributors can fork the repository, create feature branches, commit changes, and open pull requests.
